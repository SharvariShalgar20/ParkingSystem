Overview

This is a console-based Parking Slot Management System developed in C++, focusing on data structures and algorithms (DSA). The system efficiently manages parking slots for vehicles of different sizes (small, medium, large, and buses) while providing real-time allocation, removal, and optimization functionalities.
